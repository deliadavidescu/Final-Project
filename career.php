          Is your company looking for qualified programmers? No problem, we have them!
        </h3>

            <h5 class="text-secondary">
            Are you looking to hire developers? For an internship, or as fixed employees? Then you are right with us â€“ we train programmers.

            We attach great importance to independent and self-directed learning during our courses and our students gain great practical experience in real-life development projects.

            Softskills are also very important to us. Not only do we want to teach our students programming languages, we also want to teach them the skills they need in their day-to-day work as highly skilled programmers. An example of this is the ability to program as a team with complex version control, to independently establish customer contact and present results.

            Our Career_net aims to position our students directly in the industry. This can be done in two variants:
            </h5>
            <li class="ml-4 text-secondary">
              Presentation of your job offers for course participants and alumni: The CodeFactory makes your offers available to our participants in the form of a job advertisement. This service is free.
            </li>
            <li class="ml-4 text-secondary">
              The CodeFactory selects a number of fitting graduates on the basis of your requirements and wishes and will establish your mutual contact. 
              If one or more of the persons presented to you will come to be employed by your company, a fee of one gross monthly salary will be charged to cover service costs to the CodeFactory.

            </li>
            </ol>
          <ol>
            <h5 class="text-secondary">
              Secondly, we want to give you as an employer ways to present your company as an innovative and attractive place to work. This offer can also be realized in two ways:
            </h5>
            <li class="ml-4 text-secondary">
              Invitation to talk at a CodeFactory course as a lunch speaker. In this framework, you or your employees can demonstrate their competences on course topics such as technology or project management. I this venue, you can also establish initial contact with our course participants. This service is free.
            </li>
            <li class="ml-4 text-secondary">
              At the end of each CodeFactory training, a CareerDay will be held during which students will present their projects and expertise to interested companies. For participants of this event, the general conditions as described under point 2 apply.
            </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
